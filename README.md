# BinaryTree-MD2
This program was made by Keisy Chaves (Kei98) and César Hernández (cesarHj) as the final project of the Discrete Mathematics course. Basically it is a task organizer that works with two Binary Trees. One of them has two keys and the other one is simple.
This task organizer works with two keys: "actividad" (activity) and "prioridad" (priority). The tree orders itself first depending on the priority and then on the activity. The second tree (the simple one), was created to avoid the activity repetition and it belongs to the complex one.
